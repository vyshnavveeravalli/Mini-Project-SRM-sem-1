Rock Paper Scissors has been a hit with all age groups tested.  It is a classic game that is enhanced through picture animations.  However, for the future, these images could be programmed to look nicer rather than showing as a plain figure window.  Also, different versions of the game could be added so the user could choose which version they would like to play.
Rock Paper Scissors is a childhood favorite of many, and works similarly on the computer to how it does in person.  The player chooses to throw rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer plays the same on the other side.  There is an immediate winner, and the game challenges the player to try to think strategically to try to outsmart the computer.
